\section{Telemetry}

Authority nodes have to send automatic telemetry data to NetOps. This helps detecting attacks or other network disturbances early.
The following telemetry is collected and send to the telemetry SaaS provider:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CPU usage
    \item Memory usage
    \item Disk usage
    \item Number of connected blockchain peers
    \item Current block information (hash, number of tx, blocktime)
    \item Network throughput
    \item Network error rate
    \item Service status for SSH, Docker and the Parity container
    \item Statisatics per docker container
\end{itemize}
