\section{NodeControl}
\label{nodecontrol}

NodeControl is a small management application that runs on each validator node. It is in charge of carrying out simple update tasks.
It will listen to the local blockchain client via the HTTP RPC interface. 
The ethereum address of the validator account is used as a node identifier. NodeControl will only act on events directly directed to its assigned address.
This allows granular deployment of updates. \\

The trigger process is shown in Fig. ~\ref{fig:nctrigger}.
